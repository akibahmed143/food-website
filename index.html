                <p>
                    Salads are typically made by combining lettuce or mixed greens with an assortment of
                    toppings and
                    a
                    dressing.

                    With a large variety of possible mix-ins, salads can be a staple of a balanced diet. You can
                    add
                    almost any food to a salad, but some toppings are more nutritious than others.
                </p>

                    <h3>Chopped Raw Vegetables</h3>
                    <p>
                        A typical salad starts with raw greens, such as lettuce, spinach, kale, mixed greens or arugula.
                        However, you can also add several other raw vegetables.

                        Some popular raw veggie toppings include chopped carrots, onions, cucumbers, celery, mushrooms
                        and broccoli. These vegetables are packed with fiber and plant compounds that offer health
                        benefits.

                    <h3>Healthy Soup</h3>
                    <p>
                        Soup is winter's answer to salad. And while the super creamy ones that come in a bread bowl
                        taste amazing, they won't help any healthy eating goals. When you're trying to stick to a diet
                        but need a nice, warm bowl of broth, these hearty and healthy soups will fill you up.

                    <h3>Fresh Herbs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Herbs are the leaves, seeds or flowers of plants that can add flavor or fragrance to your
                        dishes.

                        Popular fresh herbs to add to salads or salad dressings include basil, mint, rosemary, parsley,
                        sage and cilantro.

                        Herbs not only add flavor but may also provide various health benefits.
